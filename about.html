        <p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at Cisco, working on backend and infra for one of Cisco's most important products which generate couple of billions in sales every year.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Stanford University in spring of 2023, with BS in Computer Science - AI track!</p>
        <p>I love anything related to technology! Growing up, I was a huge fan Star Wars and Ironman which always made me think, "I'm going to build a Millenium Falcon, an Ironman suit, and Jarvis someday!"</p>
        <p>I'm also huge fan of music: Jazz, Rap, Classical, Pop, Rock, you name it. Artists like Kendrick Lamar, John Coltrane, and Daft Punk inspire me to be creative and innovative with my projects :D</p>
